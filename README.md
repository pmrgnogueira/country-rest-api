Hello! üëã

Thanks for checking out my solution to the [REST Countries API Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

Feel free to look around and explore and give me feedback about what can be improved. üòÅ

## My process

I followed a basic process of first outlining what were the key features, pages and components I needed to build. I also decided where I needed to add state logic. After that was just building it.

### What I learned

This was my first time trying to build a frontendmentor challenge, it was a fun challenge. I was able to recap some knowledge I had gain a few months ago (when I did a full react udemy course).

I re-learned how to build a custom hook with the Fetch API and how to apply a context api.

It was also my first time trying to do a Dark/light mode app.

### Continued development

For the future I want to continue building some challenges from frontendmentor.

I want to understand what is the "best" way of sctructuring a big project and how to structure the styles in a clean way.

I want to try out styled components and other useful libraries like Formik and Next.js.

Also want to learn more about how to write clean code.

## Things I Wish I Would Have Done

- Probably thought a little bit more about how to structure the filtering/app logic as well as the styles before I started!

## Outro

Once again, feedback is welcome and appreciated! üòä

Have a nice day! üòÄ
